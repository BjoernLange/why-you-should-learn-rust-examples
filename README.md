# Why you should learn Rust: Examples

This repository contains the examples from the talk "Why you should learn Rust".
All examples demonstrate that the Rust compiler catches hard to find errors at compile time while other popular languages produce unexpected results at runtime.
Thus, the Rust example codes usually do not compile.
Hints or reworked examples are included that show possible fixes.

## Running the examples

All examples except the Python one include `build.py` and `run.py` scripts that automate building and running so no specific knowledge about the languages or its tools is required.

The following tools are required on the `PATH`:

- Java: Java 11 or higher, Maven
- C++: GCC
- Python: Python 3.9 or higher
- Rust: A standard Rust installation including `cargo` and `rustc`, supporting the 2021 edition, e.g. version 1.57 or higher
